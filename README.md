# HellaAPI

> https://awedtan.ca/api

An Arknights EN game data API made for my own use. Data is loaded from [Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData_YoStar](https://github.com/Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData_YoStar), lightly massaged into a nicer format, and sent into a MongoDB Atlas database. Made with Express and self-hosted (RIP Cyclic). Also an under construction personal project.

[See here for TypeScript data types.](https://github.com/Awedtan/HellaAPI/tree/main/types)

## Usage

### Document Selection

To query the API for a document, send an HTTP GET request to an endpoint. _Most_ endpoints support four different operations:

#### Multi

> api/resource

Returns all documents under the specified resource type.

#### Single

> api/resource/{key}

Returns a single document whose `keys` includes the specified key. Checks for exact, whole string equality.

#### Match

> api/resource/match/{key}

Returns all documents whose `keys` includes the specified key. Checks for substring matches.

#### Search

> api/resource/search?{field1}={value1}&{field2}={value2}

Returns all documents where their fields are equal to the specified values. Uses dot notation for searching nested fields.

### Additional Parameters

In addition to the four selection modes, all endpoints also support the following parameters to narrow down what data the API returns:

#### Include

> api/resource?include={field1}&include={field2}

Specify fields to include in the response. If a request contains both `include` and `exclude` parameters, only `include` parameters will be considered.

#### Exclude

> api/resource?exclude={field1}&exclude={field2}

Specify fields to exclude from the response. If a request contains both `include` and `exclude` parameters, only `include` parameters will be considered.

#### Limit

> api/resource?limit={number}

Specify a maximum number of documents to return.

### Data format

Valid responses will have the below JSON format. The `keys` array contains all valid keys for that resource, and the `value` field is where the actual information resides<sup>1</sup>.

```
{
    _id: string,
    meta: { ... },
    canon: canon_key,
    keys: [ key1, key2, ... ],
    value: {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Examples

This request will get all "Musha" operators (Hellagur, Utage, etc.) and returns their rarity.

> https://awedtan.ca/api/operator/search?data.subProfessionId=musha&include=data.rarity

The following two requests are functionally identical and will return the same object. They both exclude the `termId` and `termName` fields from the `Definition` object, leaving only the `description` field.

> https://awedtan.ca/api/define/slow?exclude=termId&exclude=termName
> 
> https://awedtan.ca/api/define/slow?include=description

Requests that return very large amounts of data may take a long time or even time out. By excluding unneeded fields, both response times and sizes can be dramatically decreased.

> This will likely time out:
>
> https://awedtan.ca/api/stage
>
> This probably won't time out but will still take a while:
>
> https://awedtan.ca/api/stage?exclude=levels
>
> This will have the fastest response time:
>
> https://awedtan.ca/api/stage?include=excel.name
