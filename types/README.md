# HellaTypes

> Formerly located at https://github.com/Awedtan/HellaTypes

A types library for data returned by HellaAPI. Provides native TS types as well as [Zod schema objects](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

These typings are largely GPT-generated and manually edited. As such, they are probably not 100% accurate.
