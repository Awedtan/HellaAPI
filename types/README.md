# HellaTypes

> Formerly located at https://github.com/Awedtan/HellaTypes

A types library for data returned by HellaAPI. Provides native TS types as well as [Zod schema objects](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

These typings are heavily GPT-generated and, as such, are probably not 100% accurate.

```sh
npm install hella-types
```
